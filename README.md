Upon running the program HW1.py, the user will be asked to enter a word and/or words. They may enter however many they like. The program will also prompt them to enter the keyboard combination of Control and d when they are finished. Once they indicate they are done the program will then print out each segment they entered but in reverse order. E.g.: �Hello� �World� will output �World� �Hello�.
#2 In problem 2 it will process the function �isodd� which takes in a list element and returns whether or not any elements within the list are an odd number when multiplied together. The user will again be asked to enter a series of numbers to their own discretion. The user will be informed to, again, enter ctrl+d when they are finished entering values. E.g. if the user enters 1,2 it will be false. And if they enter 1,2,3 it will be true.
#3 Problem 3 is the permutation section. In which it takes a list and will print every variation of the elements in that list. Again, the user will be instructed to enter values the same way they had done in problem 2; ending with ctrl+d. E.g. if user enters [1,2,3]
[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3]
[2,3,1]
[3,2,1]
[3,1,2]
#4 Finally, problem 4 counts the hamming distance between two numbers. The user will then enter an X and Y number to be compared. X must be a positive number greater than or equal to 0 and Y must be less than 2 to the 31st power. Should the user not follow these parameters, they will be asked to keep entering the value until a suitable one is found. After the user has finished inputting the values, the program will output the hamming distance between the two values. E.g.: X = 1, Y = 4 Output: 2
